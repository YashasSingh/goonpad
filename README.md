# USB Hub Macro Pad with Customizable Keys


## Description
This is a custom-built USB hub macro pad that combines a 4-port USB hub with programmable macro keys and RGB lighting. The device features Kailh mechanical switches for macro functions, customizable key bindings, an OLED display, rotary encoder, and acts as a powered USB hub for connecting multiple devices. Built around a XIAO RP2040 microcontroller that handles both USB hub functionality and macro key programming with WS2812B RGB LEDs for visual feedback.

## Why I Made This
I aimed to desgin a multifunctional deskop accessory that fulfills two main fuctions: expanding USB connectivty and making it quicker to access commands, shortcuts, and macros I use alot. This gets rid of the need for seprate gadgets and helps keep the workspace clean and effiecent. Adding RGB lights and an OLED screen gives nice visual feedback and lets me mess around with customizations.
## Features
- 4-port USB hub functionality
- 6 programmable macro keys with Kailh switches
- RGB LED lighting (WS2812B)
- OLED display for status and information
- Rotary encoder for navigation/volume control
- Custom 3D printed case
- XIAO RP2040 microcontroller for programming flexibility
